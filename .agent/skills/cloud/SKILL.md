# Cloud Skill

Use this skill for Firebase Functions, cloud triggers, deploy-time cloud concerns, and cross-service cloud integration points.

## Triggers
- firebase
- cloud function
- trigger
- serverless
- deploy function

## Rules
1. Enforce explicit auth checks for protected operations.
2. Keep functions idempotent and single-purpose.
3. Log key events for production diagnostics.
4. Keep latency-sensitive paths minimal.
