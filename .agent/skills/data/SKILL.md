# Data Skill

Use this skill for retrieval quality, indexing, ingestion consistency, and database query behavior.

## Triggers
- rag
- retrieval
- vector search
- ingestion
- indexing
- database query

## Rules
1. Keep retrieval and generation concerns separate.
2. Make indexing state and freshness explicit.
3. Prefer deterministic data flow over hidden side effects.
4. Validate performance impact for query or index changes.
